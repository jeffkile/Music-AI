	  These variables are not really intended to be static in a

	  can't just be automatic variables. There were three possibilities:

	  a) make them instance variables and instantiate the object they
	  belong to. This is clean (and is how you should do it in a real
	  application), but would have made the example more complex.

	  b) make them automatic final variables inside main(). Design-wise,
	  this is better than static, but automatic final is something that
	  is still like some black magic to me.

	  c) make them static variables, as it is done here. This is quite bad
	  design, because if you have global variables, you can't easily do
	  the thing they are used for two times in concurrency without risking
	  indeterministic behaviour. However, it makes the example easy to
	  read.
